#While loop challenge8 (gcsecs.com)

#part of this code it missing.
#It should ask the user to guess a number over and over again, but..
#only give them 5 attempts.
#If they guess correct, it displays 'Yay! Correct guess'
#otherwise it prints 'You are out of attempts'
#HINT: Use an "and" opertor


import random
number = random.randint(1,10)
attempts = 5
guess = ""


#add a While loop here
while guess != number:
  attempts = attempts -1
  guess = int(input("Guess a number"))

if guess == number:
  print("Yay you got it")
else:
  print("You are out of attempts")
